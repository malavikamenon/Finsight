- Click on "New codespace" to launch a new Codespace environment
- Edit files directly within the Codespace and commit your changes when done

## Technology Stack

This project leverages modern web development technologies:

- **Vite** - Lightning-fast build tool and development server[2][5]
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript for better development experience[2][3]
- **React** - Popular library for building user interfaces[2][6]
- **shadcn-ui** - Beautiful and accessible component library
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling

## TypeScript Configuration

The project includes a properly configured `tsconfig.json` file that enables:
- Modern ES6+ features
- JSX support with React
- Strict type checking for better code quality
- DOM library support for web development[5][7]

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start the development server
- `npm run build` - Build the project for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview the production build locally
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint to check code quality

## Deployment

This project can be deployed to various hosting platforms:

- **Vercel** - Optimal for React applications with zero configuration
- **Netlify** - Great for static site deployment with continuous deployment
- **GitHub Pages** - Free hosting for open source projects
- **AWS S3 + CloudFront** - Scalable cloud hosting solution

To build for production, run:
```npm run build```


This creates an optimized build in the `dist` folder ready for deployment.

## Custom Domain Setup

Most hosting providers support custom domain configuration through their dashboard or DNS settings. Consult your hosting provider's documentation for specific instructions on connecting a custom domain.
